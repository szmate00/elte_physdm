# Data mining and machine learning - 2020 Fall
Repository for my coursework in "Data mining and machine learning" course at ELTE<br>
The final grade is determined by the result of the homeworks and one main project in 80/20 proportion.
## Homeworks
**1. Exploratory data analysis**<br>
**2. Unsupervised learning & clustering**<br>
**3. Supervised learning introduction, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**<br>
**4. Linear regression**<br>
**5. Logistic regression**<br>
**6. Model selection**<br>
*(Some notebooks use interactive plots like plotly, use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to be able to render them appropriately.)*
