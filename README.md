# Data mining and machine learning - Fall 2020
Repository for my coursework in "Data mining and machine learning" course at ELTE<br>
The final grade is determined by the result of the homeworks and one main project in 80/20 proportion.
## Homeworks
**1. [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/szmate00/elte_physdm/blob/master/Homework%201/01_hw_solution.ipynb)** score: 9.0/10<br>
**2. [Unsupervised learning & clustering](https://github.com/szmate00/elte_physdm/blob/master/Homework%202/02_unsup_cluster_hw.ipynb)** score: 10/10<br>
**3. [Supervised learning introduction, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/szmate00/elte_physdm/blob/master/Homework%203/03_knn_hw.ipynb)** score: 10/10<br>
**4. [Linear regression](https://github.com/szmate00/elte_physdm/blob/master/Homework%204/04_linreg_hw.ipynb)** score: 9.5/10<br>
**5. [Logistic regression](https://github.com/szmate00/elte_physdm/blob/master/Homework%205/05_logreg_hw.ipynb)** score: 9.5/10<br>
**6. [Model selection](https://github.com/szmate00/elte_physdm/blob/master/Homework%206/06_modelselection_hw.ipynb)** score: 9.0/10<br>
*(Some notebooks use interactive plots like plotly, use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to be able to render them appropriately.)*
